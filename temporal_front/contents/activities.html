At our home building at Miestentie 3 we host monthly DADA Nights -get-togethers, weekly Games club, we run a SnackBar and take part in improving the general comfort and amenities of our premises.

DADA collaborates with companies related to design and media industry and we conduct monthly company visits. DADA keeps an eye on our newcomers too, and organises tutoring in collaboration with the department.

We take trips together too! This spring we are sailing to Tallinn to introduce our members to local design and new media networks, and later in autumn we will do another excursion to Stockholm.
